Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute code to `Kiel` you can do so through GitHub by
forking the repository and sending a pull request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions
and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible. Please also make
sure your code compiles by running `./gradlew build` (or `gradlew.bat build` on Windows)
and passing the tests by running `./gradlew check` (or `gradlew.bat check` on Windows).
